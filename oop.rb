# Accessors and Setters
# Accessors are methods that allow you to read the value of an instance variable.
# Setters are methods that allow you to set the value of an instance variable.
# like java getters and setters, they provide encapsulation

# Using Symbols with attr_accessor
# attr_accessor is a Ruby method that creates accessors and setters for instance variables.
# It is a shortcut for creating accessor and setter methods.
# It takes a symbol as an argument and creates accessor and setter methods for the instance variable with that name.

# Using Symbols with attr_reader and attr_writer
# attr_reader is a Ruby method that creates accessor methods for instance variables.
# attr_writer is a Ruby method that creates setter methods for instance variables.
# They are shortcuts for creating accessor and setter methods.
# They take a symbol as an argument and create accessor and setter methods for the instance variable with that name.

# Access Control
# Ruby provides three levels of access control for methods: public, protected, and private.
# Public methods can be called by anyone.
# Protected methods can be called by any instance of the defining class or its subclasses.
# Private methods can only be called within the defining class.
# By default, all methods in Ruby are public.
# To define a protected method, use the protected keyword.
# To define a private method, use the private keyword.
# To define a public method, no keyword is needed.

  def initialize(w, h)
    @width, @height = w, h

  end

  def height

  end

  protected

  def print_area
    puts "Box area is: #{area}"

# Class Inheritance
# Ruby supports single inheritance
# < is used to inherit from a class
# super keyword is used to call the parent class constructor

class BigBox < Box
  def print_big_box_area
    print_area # Protected method can be called within subclass
  end
end

box = Box.new(10, 20)
big_box = BigBox.new(30, 40)

# box.print_area # => Error: protected method `print_area' called
big_box.print_big_box_area # => Box area is: 1200

# Freezing Objects
# Ruby provides a method called freeze that prevents objects from being modified.

class Person

  def initialize(id, name)
    @id = id
    @name = name
  end

  def to_s
    "ID: #{@id}, Name: #{@name}"

# Create Objects using allocate
# The allocate method is used to create a new object without calling the initialize method.
# It is useful when you want to create an object without initializing it.
# use cases:
# mmm... actually, I think is useless like unless and until ðŸ¦¦

class Street
